# FACE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS USING DEEPFACE 
# Face Insight

## Overview
**Face Insight** is a Python-based AI Model created for extracting and analyzing faces from PDF documents. It converts PDFs to images, detects faces using MTCNN, and analyzes age, gender, and race using DeepFace. The extracted data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.The input that was did to develop this model was adevertisements form various print magazines.
## Features
- üñºÔ∏è Converts PDFs into images
- üîç Detects faces using MTCNN
- üßë‚Äçü§ñ Analyzes age, gender, and race with DeepFace
- üìä Saves extracted data into a CSV file
- ‚ö° Ideal for advertisement analysis and AI-powered document processing

## Installation
To use Face Insight, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas pdf2image deepface mtcnn pillow
```

## Usage
Run the script by specifying the folder containing PDFs:
```sh
python script.py
```

## CSV Output Format
The processed face data is stored in a CSV file with the following columns:
```
AD ID, Faces on Image, Age, Gender, Race, Image Path
```

### Sample CSV Data
```
AD_001, 2, 25, Man, Asian, output_faces/AD_001_1_face_0.jpg
AD_002, 1, 30, Woman, Caucasian, output_faces/AD_002_1_face_0.jpg
```
Here is an example of sample csv data.

the code successfully detects multiple images and lists it in excel,easy for comparsion especially for large datsets.
